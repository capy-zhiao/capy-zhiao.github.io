# üê£ about-me

Hi, I'm Zhiao Wei, I have just obtained the degree of Bachelor of Engineering in Cybersecurity from <a href="https://www.scu.edu.cn/">Sichuan University</a> on 20 June 2023. Before I graduate, I have been actively involved in research during my time at the <a href="http://www.is.cas.cn/">Intelligence Engineering Lab at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)</a>. After that, I also have a project with <a href="https://www.osu.edu/">The Ohio State University</a>.

<h2>Ph.D. Aspirations</h2>
  <a style="color:red; text-decoration:none;">I'm actively seeking a Ph.D. position for Fall 2024, and I'm committed to making projects that integrate with real-world security and privacy!</a>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
I am currently immersed in research focusing on the convergence of security and privacy within the realm of IoT and mobile devices. My exploration delves into the potential repercussions of vulnerabilities present in various smart devices, illustrating how they can significantly compromise real-life privacy. This encompasses an array of concerns, such as weak authentication mechanisms and inadvertent privacy breaches, spanning from smart homes and healthcare devices to wireless routers.

In the long term, my research aspirations center around the consistent enhancement of privacy-conscious security measures for both IoT and mobile devices. I maintain a strong conviction that the amalgamation of smart devices and research emphasizing privacy can wield a substantial and lasting impact.

Now, my research skills are mainly in these areas:
  <ul>
      <li><b>Binary security</b>: Binary program analysis, IoT Security, Software security.</li>
      <li><b>Cyber  security</b>: Penetration, Privacy protection.</li>
  </ul>
